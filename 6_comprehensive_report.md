## Technical Architecture

### Four-Stage Calibration Framework

#### 1. Offset-Scale Correction
Initial systematic error correction using linear transformation:

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
x_corrected(t) = b_s * (x_raw(t) - a_s)
```

Where:
- `x_corrected(t)` is the corrected measurement at time t
- `x_raw(t)` is the raw sensor reading
- `a_s` represents the mean shift (constant offset)
- `b_s` represents the scale factor (proportional error)

**Parameter Estimation:**
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
- Linear regression of reference against raw measurements
- Transformation of regression coefficients to correction parameters

**Purpose:** Removes large systematic biases before applying more nuanced calibration

#### 2. Dynamic Trust Assessment
Continuous trust scoring based on four performance indicators:

**Trust Score Components:**
- **Accuracy (A_s):** Closeness to reference measurements using exponential error penalty
- **Stability (S_s):** Temporal variability measured through 24-hour rolling standard deviation
- **Responsiveness (R_s):** Short-term fluctuation tracking via first-order difference correlation
- **Consensus Alignment (C_s):** Agreement with spatially weighted neighbor measurements

**Trust Score Calculation:**
```
T_s = (A_s + S_s + R_s + C_s) / 4
```

**Range:** Trust scores bounded between [0.2, 1.0] to prevent complete exclusion

**Dynamic Updates:** Continuous recalculation based on recent performance

#### 3. Multi-Scale Feature Engineering
Comprehensive feature set capturing temporal and spatial dynamics:

**Feature Categories:**
- **Direct Measurements (D_s):** Raw corrected values, time of day, first-order differences
- **Wavelet Features (W_s):** Daubechies-1 wavelet decomposition with 3 levels
- **Network Features (N_s):** Trust-weighted spatial consensus and correlations
- **Environmental Features (E_s):** Adaptive rolling statistics (mean, std, min, max)

**Adaptive Windowing:**
```
W_min = max(1, [24 - (1 - T_s) * 16])
```

Window size adapts based on trust score, with less reliable sensors using shorter windows

#### 4. Trust-Weighted Consensus Integration
Final calibration blending raw measurements with model predictions:

**Dynamic Model Architecture:**
- **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)** with trust-adapted hyperparameters
- **Number of Trees:** Increases for lower trust scores (100-200 range)
- **Learning Rate:** Decreases for less reliable sensors (0.1 - 0.03 range)
- **Tree Depth:** Deeper models for poorly performing sensors (2-4 range)

**Final Blending:**
```
y_calibrated(t) = w(T_s) * x_corrected(t) + [1 - w(T_s)] * M_s(F_s(t))
```

Where `w(T_s) = min(T_s, 0.8)` prevents over-reliance on raw measurements
