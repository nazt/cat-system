## Executive Summary

This research introduces an innovative blockchain-enabled demand-side management (DSM) model that combines cap-and-trade mechanisms with peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. The study addresses critical challenges in energy demand management by proposing a decentralized platform that incentivizes energy conservation while enabling direct energy trading between consumers. The model is validated through simulation with 200 households, demonstrating benefits for both energy companies and consumers.
