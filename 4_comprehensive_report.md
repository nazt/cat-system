## Technical Architecture

### System Components

#### 1. Three-Layer Trading Framework
The proposed system operates on three distinct levels:

**Level 1: Prosumer-Centric Trading**
- Direct energy trading between prosumers within microgrids
- Smart contract-based auction mechanism
- Individual optimization algorithms for bid/sale price decisions
- Automatic financial rewards based on carbon emission behavior

**Level 2: Microgrid-Trader Trading**
- Virtual entities managing groups of physically connected prosumers
- Optimization for energy balance between microgrids
- Aggregation of excess energy transactions
- Inter-microgrid trading coordination

**Level 3: P2P Trading Platform**
- Standardized settlement processes for energy and fuel allowances
- Self-enforcing smart contracts with automated execution
- Vendor-initiated auctions with buyer matching
- Secure payment and ownership transfer mechanisms

#### 2. Blockchain Infrastructure
- **Technology:** Distributed ledger technology providing transparency and security
- **Smart Contracts:** Automated execution of trading agreements
- **Tokenization:** Digital representation of carbon allowances as tradable assets
- **Security:** Immutable record-keeping preventing tampering and fraud

#### 3. Mathematical Framework
The system employs sophisticated optimization models:

**Prosumer Optimization:**
```
Min: Σ(d_k,t - g_i,t)·δt·b_energy,t
```
Subject to energy balance constraints and bidding rules.

**Carbon Allowance Calculation:**
```
y(r_allow,t, r_net,t) = α·(r_allow,t·δt)² - (r_net,t·δt)²
```

**Auction Mechanism:**
- Multi-phase process including initialization, matching, bidding, and settlement
- Trust-weighted consensus for reliable price discovery
- Automatic verification and payment processing
